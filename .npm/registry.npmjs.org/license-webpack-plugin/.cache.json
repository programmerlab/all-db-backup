Note all fields are optional unless noted otherwise.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  pattern: undefined, // Required. regex of licenses to include.\n  licenseFilenames: [ // list of filenames to search for in each package\n    'LICENSE',\n    'LICENSE.md',\n    'LICENSE.txt',\n    'license',\n    'license.md',\n    'license.txt'\n  ],\n  perChunkOutput: true, // whether or not to generate output for each chunk, for just create one file with all the licenses combined\n  outputTemplate: path.resolve(__dirname, '../output.template.ejs'), // ejs template for rendering the licenses\n  outputFilename: '[name].licenses.txt', // output name. [name] refers to the chunk name here. Any properties of the chunk can be used here, such as [hash]. If perChunkOutput is false, the default value is 'licenses.txt'\n  suppressErrors: false, // suppress error messages\n  includePackagesWithoutLicense: false, // whether or not to include packages that are missing a license\n  unacceptablePattern: undefined, // regex of unacceptable licenses\n  abortOnUnacceptableLicense: false, // whether or not to abort the build if an unacceptable license is detected\n  addBanner: false, // whether or not to add a banner to the beginning of all js files in the chunk indicating where the licenses are\n  bannerTemplate: // ejs template string of how the banner shold appear at the beginning of each js file in the chunk\n    '/*! 3rd party license information is available at <%- filename %> */',\n  includedChunks: [], // array of chunk names for which license files should be produced\n  excludedChunks: [], // array of chunk names for which license files should not be produced. If a chunk is both included and excluded, then it is ultimately excluded.\n  additionalPackages: [] // array of additional packages to scan\n}\n```\n\nWARNING: If you are importing css from node\\_modules indirectly via something like a sass `@import`, the package will not appear in your list. This is because libsass processes all `@import` statements before the css is provided to webpack. Thus webpack (and this plugin) will have no way to tell what css files were imported. You can work around this by directly importing css from node\\_modules inside a javascript file. Alternatively, you can force a particular module to be in the output for all chunks by using the `additionalPackages` option.\n\n## Build Instructions\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n##
