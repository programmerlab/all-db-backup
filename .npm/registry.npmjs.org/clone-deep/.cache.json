Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save clone-deep\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar cloneDeep = require('clone-deep');\n\nvar obj = {a: 'b'};\nvar arr = [obj];\n\nvar copy = cloneDeep(arr);\nobj.c = 'd';\n\nconsole.log(copy);\n//=> [{a: 'b'}]\n\nconsole.log(arr);\n//=> [{a: 'b', c: 'd'}]\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nThe `instanceClone` function is invoked to clone objects that are not \"plain\" objects (as defined by [isPlainObject](#isPlainObject)`isPlainObject`) if it is provided. If `instanceClone` is not specified, it will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will copy the object reference.\n\n## Attribution\n\nBased on [mout's](https://github.com/mout/mout) implementation of deepClone.\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [is-plain-object](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-plain-object): Returns true if an object was created by the `Object` constructor. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-plain-object \"Returns true if an object was created by the `Object` constructor.\")\n* [isobject](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isobject): Returns true if the value is an object and not an array or null. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/isobject \"Returns true if the value is an object and not an array or null.\")\n* [kind-of](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kind-of): Get the native type of a value. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/kind-of \"Get the native type of a value.\")\n* [shallow-clone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shallow-clone): Make a shallow clone of an object, array or primitive. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/shallow-clone \"Make a shallow clone of an object, array or primitive.\")\n\n### Contributing\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
