primitive.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save shallow-clone\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar clone = require('shallow-clone');\n```\n\n## shallow clones arrays\n\nThe array itself is cloned, but not the elements of the array. So any objects in the array will still not be cloned (e.g. they will be the same object as in the orginal array).\n\n```js\nvar arr = [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\nvar foo = clone(arr);\n// foo =>  [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\n\n// array is cloned\nassert.equal(actual === expected, false);\n\n// array elements are not\nassert.deepEqual(actual[0], expected[0]); // true\n```\n\n## returns primitives as-is\n\n```js\nclone(0)\n//=> 0\n\nclone('foo')\n//=> 'foo'\n```\n\n## shallow clone a regex\n\n```js\nclone(/foo/g)\n//=> /foo/g\n```\n\n## shallow clone an object\n\n```js\nclone({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })\n//=> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n```\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [assign-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assign-deep): Deeply assign the enumerable properties and/or es6 Symbol properies of source objects to the target… [more](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep) | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep \"Deeply assign the enumerable properties and/or es6 Symbol properies of source objects to the target (first) object.\")\n* [clone-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clone-deep): Recursively (deep) clone JavaScript native types, like Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep \"Recursively (deep) clone JavaScript native types, like Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives.\")\n* [extend-shallow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extend-shallow): Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow \"Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util.\")\n* [is-plain-object](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-plain-object): Returns true if an object was created by the `Object` constructor. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-plain-object \"Returns true if an object was created by the `Object` constructor.\")\n* [isobject](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isobject): Returns true if the value is an object and not an array or null. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/isobject \"Returns true if the value is an object and not an array or null.\")\n* [kind-of](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kind-of): Get the native type of a value. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/kind-of \"Get the native type of a value.\")\n* [mixin-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mixin-deep): Deeply mix the properties of objects into the first object.
